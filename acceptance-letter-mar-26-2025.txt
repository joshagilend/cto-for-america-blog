Dear World,

I invented a religion. The religion of DoD Cloud. I built it. I invented it. I thought it up. You can too.

We invent Cloud every year, every nation, for millions of people. We are built by opportunity, by device, and by creed. We live as one people on this Earth because we believe in the principles of freedom and goodness.

If you are like me, join now. We are hiring 30,000 engineers every year for 30 years. We are built with the stuff of space, stars, and human hearts. Commit to the mission and see your heart out.
